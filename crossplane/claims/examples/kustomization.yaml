# These are examples - do not apply all at once in production!
# Pick and choose based on your needs

resources:
  # Uncomment the examples you want to deploy
  
  # Simple resource group
  # - resourcegroup-claim.yaml
  
  # Storage account (requires resource group)
  # - storage-account-claim.yaml
  
  # Complete network setup (requires resource group)
  # - network-claim.yaml
  
  # PostgreSQL database (requires resource group and network)
  # - postgresql-claim.yaml

# Note: Comment out resources you don't want to deploy
# These examples have dependencies on each other:
# 1. Start with resource group
# 2. Then add network or storage
# 3. Finally add database (if needed)
